                There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artist, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.
                <br>
                Moreover, they think doing what they will make you successful but that not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful that is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they what they like to do not what that others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do also they do what they feel correct for their business.
                <br>
                If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one's goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.

    <h1>The Road to Success</h1>
            <p3>I am very pleased and honored today standing in front of you my dear classmates. I would like to start with a quote: “The road to success is not straight. There is a curve called Failure, a loop called Confusion, speed bumps called Friends, red lights called Enemies, caution lights called Family. You will have flat tires called Jobs, but if you have a spare called Determination, an engine called Perseverance,
                <br> A driver called Will Power, you will make it to a place called Success.” This quote appropriately spells the formula of success which I want to share to you today.

We were trained to do the household works.
